#personal-site-rewrite

I'm trying to learn some backbone, so I decided to just rewrite the jquery mess on chadmcelligott.com to use backbone instead.

To make development easier, I also decided to try out require.js and gulp. I'm using require.js to structure my code in a more modular fashion, and gulp as a replacement for grunt because I'm not a huge fan of the way gruntfiles are a huge messy configuration file.

###running

To run the site in it's current state:

```shell
npm install
bower install
gulp
```
